## Diagnosis
There is variable named --chrome-nav-bar-separator-color that is no longer used
or referenced in any files. All the entries of the variable will have to be
removed, as well as the entry for this bug in the whitelist for the test cases
that cover it.

## Solution
I will search the mozilla-central source code for all occurrences of the variable
mentioned above. I will remove uses of the variable as well as any
blocks of code that are only used to operate on this variable.

## Testing
Before fixing the code, if the entry for the bug in browser_parsable_css.js
was not whitelisted, the tests would not pass. However, after fixing the bug
and removing it from the whitelist, the tests pass as expected.
