In Python Int objects are treated as a language C's Long object, 
which essentially means Python Int objects could be anything it wants to be
as long as the variable is 32-bit. 
This is undoubtedly acceptable as long as we use Python for implementation,
however, Mozilla is integrated using various languages including Java and C++
which are very sensitive to Int object's limit and even if there do exist 
overflow, Int variables will not indicate such problem and the value of the 
variable will flip. Which means that the Max-value will now become a Min-value 
and this could cause tremendous problem without the knowledge of the developers.

Parse Histogram appears to be using set_bucket_parameter to check for any potential
error for every bucket. My solution is to place a error checking ParseError 
which utilizes ctypes to check if low or high is beyong int limit. 
In this case, if these variables is in fact beyond the int limit, by using 
ctypes.c_int, these variables value would now become negative.
Thus if either of them are beyond int limit, than if statement would be triggered 
and error message will be outputted. 

As part of the testing I tried running mach test toolkit/components/telemetry/tests/
as specified by the bug note.
