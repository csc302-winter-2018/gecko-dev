## Diagnosis
There is variable named --chrome-nav-bar-separator-color that is no longer used
or referenced in any files. All the entries of the variable will have to be
removed, as well as the entry for this bug in the whitelist for the test cases
that cover it.

## Solution
I will search the mozilla-central source code for all occurrences of 
--chrome-nav-bar-separator-color.  I will remove all uses of the variable as well 
as any blocks of code that use or contain references only to nav and nothing else.

## Testing
Before fixing the code, if the entry for the bug in browser_parsable_css.js
was not whitelisted, the browser tests would not pass. However, after fixing the bug
and removing it from the whitelist, the tests pass as expected.
