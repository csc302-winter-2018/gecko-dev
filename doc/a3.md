## Diagnosis
<!-- Diagnosis of your bug. Describe in English what the issue is, and what the benefit of fixing will bring. What risks are there, if any? -->
The bug is that there is an attribute that is set but never referenced in the build. This causes the code base to be cluttered, and also raises warnings. There is a setting, --in-content-category on line 13 in the preferences.inc.css file that is never used.

## Solution
<!-- Propose a  solution. Describe in English what you’d do, and the step by step process you’d follow. The goal is to present your reasoning to the person who would be evaluating your patch. -->
To solve this bug, I first located the preferences.inc.css file within the Firefox source code, and found the unnecessary code, which was the --in-content-category property. There was also another file which ensures that css files have proper formatting and conventions, browser_parsable_css.js, which has a whitelist of different unused properties based on bugs, so the entry for this bug was removed.

## Testing
<!-- Testing document - A process (or description of a process) by which you’d evaluate the success of your work.  (See Note 1) How do you know your change addresses the bug?
Screen shots, if necessary, showing issue and the correct behaviour with your fix applied. -->
To check whether removing the code breaks anything, I have checked the rest of the source code for code that references or uses that part of the css file, and none do. Firefox still builds properly, and the behaviour of the program remains working after the bug fix.

## Patch
<!-- In separate text file, named doc/NNNN.patch (where NNNN is the bugzilla bug number).
